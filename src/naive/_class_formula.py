    """A Boolean logic phi.

    *Formulas are syntactically correct expressions in a formalized language defined over a signature, a set of variables, and a logics. In this way, formulas are quite similar to terms. Since predicates and logics symbols are included in their inductive definition, they represent truth values instead of sort values, however.*
