# TODO: Core: Question: The language key is ambiguous. Should we remove it and rely on scope + base_key to uniquely identify concepts?

# TODO: ST1: Complete the declare_finite_set function.

# TODO: ST1: Implement the is_element_of binary operator. e --> S. This will require a "local" Universal set.

# TODO: ST1: Implement the has_element binary operator.

# TODO: ST1: Implement the subset and strict subset operators.

# TODO: ST1: Implement the superset and strict superset operators.

# TODO: BA2: Enriched Boolean Logic algebra with all operators, etc.

# TODO: NA1: Basic natural number algebra, e.g. with N0

# TODO: BA1: Satisfies operator.

# TODO: DESIGN CHOICE: wrap concept creation in a generic function. check facets consistency in that function.
#    like this, we assume that concepts are consistent at initialization time and avoid rechecking consistency at use time.

# TODO: DESIGN CHOICE: instead of populating all utf8, html, etc. properties, inject a single Representable object
#    as a concept property. Like this we can directly reuse Glyphs or other constructions.
#   and we avoid

# TODO: Implement Venn diagram representations of finite sets.
