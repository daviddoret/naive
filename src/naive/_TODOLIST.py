# TODO: Core: Rename facet_key to facets and provide support with generic functions for multiple facets per concept

# TODO: Core: Because of support for multiple facets, concept identification can no longer rely on facets. Also,
#   ...the language key is ambiguous. I suggest to remove it and rely on scope + base_key to uniquely identify concepts.

# TODO: ST1: Complete the declare_finite_set function.

# TODO: ST1: Implement the is_element_of binary operator. e --> S. This will require a "local" Universal set.

# TODO: ST1: Implement the has_element binary operator.

# TODO: ST1: Implement the subset and strict subset operators.

# TODO: ST1: Implement the superset and strict superset operators.

# TODO: BA2: Enriched Boolean Logic algebra with all operators, etc.
