    This utility function converts embedded lists or multidimensional objects to vectors.

    If x is already a flat list, returns a new list instance with the same elements.

    If x is not iterable, returns an iterable version of x, that is: [x].

    If x is None, returns an empty list, that is [].

        x (object): Any object but preferably an iterable object of type: abc.Iterable[typing.Any].
