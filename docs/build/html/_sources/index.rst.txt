Welcome to Naive's documentation!
===================================

**Naive** (/naɪˈiːv/) is a model checking Python library. Its salient characteristics are:

* Aggressive but transparent (i.e. warnings issuance) type coercion,

* Mimicking mathematical objects with Python classes (i.e. an approach we may coin semantic development),

* Prioritize readability over code performance.

    This project is under active development.
